"""Rolls up YouTube Analytics data for videos that have matured since
publish (config.growth.maturity_days) into config/performance_stats.json,
which niche_selector.py reads to bias future (niche, format) choices toward
what's actually working.

Meant to run on its own schedule, separate from run_pipeline.py - a video's
stats aren't meaningful until they've had time to settle, so this is a
distinct cron in .github/workflows/sync_analytics.yml rather than a step
tacked onto every publish run.
